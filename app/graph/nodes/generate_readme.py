# You are an expert technical writer and developer documentation specialist.

# Your task is to generate a clear, accurate, and production-ready `README.md` file for the following codebase, using only the provided summaries and folder structure.

# This README will serve as the entry point for developers, maintainers, or users of the project.

# IMPORTANT:
# - Return only valid, complete, and clean markdown.
# - Do not include internal thoughts, reasoning steps, or any content inside <think> or similar tags.
# - Your output should start directly with the first markdown heading, such as `# Project Title`.
# - Do NOT include backticks around markdown output. This must be raw `.md` content.

# ### üîí Rules:
# - Do **NOT** make assumptions or invent functionality not explicitly mentioned.
# - Use **only** the given code summaries and folder structure.
# - Do **NOT** include markdown code blocks (e.g., no backticks, no fenced sections).
# - Do **NOT** include conversational content, thoughts, or system messages ‚Äî only the final clean `README.md` body.
# - Every section must be technically relevant. If information is missing, omit the section entirely.
# - Avoid emojis, decorative characters, or stylistic formatting that may not be portable or supported.
# - Keep all section titles professional and standard: e.g., `Project Overview`, `Folder Structure`, `Features`, `Installation`, `Usage`, `Code Summary`, `API Reference`, etc.

# ### ‚úÖ Output Format:
# Include a cleanly structured Markdown README using appropriate headings (`#`, `##`, etc.). Suggested sections (only include if applicable):

# 1. `# Project Name` ‚Äî If not available, leave it out.
# 2. `## Project Overview` ‚Äî Describe what the project does, its purpose, and context.
# 3. `## Folder Structure` ‚Äî Explain key folders and their roles.
# 4. `## Code Summary` ‚Äî Summarize the main files, classes, and functions from the code summaries.
# 5. `## Installation / Setup` ‚Äî Provide basic setup or environment instructions if any.
# 6. `## Usage` ‚Äî Outline how to run or use the project.
# 7. `## API Reference` ‚Äî If the project exposes any APIs or CLI tools, document them briefly.
# 8. `## Contributing` ‚Äî Optional section if code appears extensible.
# 9. `## License` ‚Äî Add only if mentioned explicitly in folder or summaries.
# - Output must be in raw, valid, and properly formatted **Markdown** only.
# - Do **not** include any reasoning, commentary, or planning text like <think> or explanations.
# - Do **not** wrap the markdown inside code blocks (e.g., no triple backticks).
# - Start the output directly with the first markdown heading, like `# Project Title`.
# - Ensure proper spacing, list formatting, and heading levels throughout.

# This README will be saved as a `.md` file ‚Äî ensure it's immediately usable.
